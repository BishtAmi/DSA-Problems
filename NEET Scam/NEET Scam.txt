NEET SCAM
Problem statement:
NEET is one of the most competitive medical exams in the country. Ram, a NEET aspirant, had been preparing dedicatedly for two years. When he got his result, he found that he scored 720 out of 720,
which made him very happy. 
However, when he saw his rank, he became very disappointed. Suspecting a possible scam, he asked you, a cyber expert, to investigate the issue.

You are given an array containing the marks of n aspirants, and you need to find the scam factor of the entire array. 
The scam factor is the number of possible pairs of marks that can be formed where the marks are equal. 
Specifically, it is the total number of possible pairs (i,j) such that marks[i]==marks[j].

Input:
The first line contains t, the number of test cases. The second line contains n, the size of the array, and the third line contains the marks of the n aspirants.

1 <= t <= 10000
1 <= n <= 100000
1 <= a[i] <= 1000000000

Output:
return the total scam factor of the array.

Example:

Input:

4
1 2 1 1

Output:

Explanation:

The number of pairs having same value
(0,2), (0,3) and (2,3) so the total scam factor is 3.
